    <h2>What is Boxing? </h2>
    <p>
        Amateur boxing bouts comprise three rounds of three minutes for men, and four rounds of two minutes for women, each with a one-minute interval between rounds.<br>
        Men's senior bouts changed in format from four two-minute rounds to three three-minute rounds on January 1, 2009.<br>
        Amateur boxing rewards point-scoring blows, based on the number of clean punches landed, rather than physical power.
