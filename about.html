    <h2>Indiana's State Tournament </h2>
    <p>
        Since the first Golden Gloves tournament in 1923, the Golden Gloves of America, Inc. and its member franchises have provided an opportunity and environment for young athletes to develop lifetime skills.<br>
        Hundreds of dedicated administrators, coaches, trainers and counselors have unselfishly spent countless times and effort to assist young people in the development of personal character and athletic skills.<br>
        The Golden Gloves program has led the way in promoting amateur boxing in the United States and has produced the majority of competitors for America's boxing teams in the Pan-Am and Olympic Games.
